# Agave Performance Optimization - Master Execution Plan

## Overview
This plan executes performance optimizations for Agave validator to achieve optimal trading bot node performance. We prioritize low-hanging fruit first, validate changes component by component, and separate functional changes from non-functional ones.

## Phases Overview

### Phase 0: Build & Runtime Setup (Days 1-2)
- **Goal**: Immediate gains with zero code changes
- **Effort**: Low
- **Risk**: Minimal
- **Expected Gain**: 10-20% performance improvement

### Phase 1: Low-Hanging Fruit (Days 3-10)
- **Goal**: Quick wins with minimal functional changes
- **Effort**: Low-Medium
- **Risk**: Low
- **Expected Gain**: 15-30% performance improvement

### Phase 2: Component-Specific Optimizations (Days 11-25)
- **Goal**: Targeted improvements per component
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Risk**: Medium
- **Expected Gain**: 20-40% performance improvement

### Phase 3: Functional Improvements (Days 26-40)
- **Goal**: New features like caching, buffering, architectural changes
- **Effort**: High
- **Risk**: High
- **Expected Gain**: 30-50% performance improvement

## Success Criteria
- **Primary**: Validator stays within 5 slots of network tip consistently
- **Secondary**: Transaction processing latency < 50ms p95
- **Tertiary**: Memory usage < 16GB during normal operation
- **Safety**: All tests pass, no functional regressions

## Development Process
- Commit after each working sub-milestone
- Run `cargo test` and `cargo build --release` before marking tasks complete
- Benchmark at major checkpoints (end of each phase)
- Add `[PERF-TODO]` comments for future work
- Never hardcode fixes for build/test failures

## Risk Mitigation
- Start with one component before expanding optimizations
- Maintain feature flags for quick rollback
- Keep separate branches for each phase
- Extensive testing at each milestone
